1. Read the current state of the working directory and any tests/build output to ground yourself.
2. Make concrete forward progress on the goal — write code, run tests, fix bugs.
3. End your response with a short progress note (3-5 lines): what you did this iteration, what is still left, blockers if any. The driver appends this to SUMMARY.md for the next iteration.
4. If — and only if — the goal is fully complete and verified, output the completion sentinel.
